Nitro seeks to replicat the experience of the classic arcade racing game- with a twist. Using browser location services and the TomTom Traffic Flow API, Nitro is able to calculate the difficulty of the game based on the traffic at your location, providing a gaming experience with maximum immersion as you fly through the streets.
